A git back-up of the dotfiles i use personally.

Contains:
  # VimRC:
      My vim config which is a mix of the vimrcs you can find under:
      1. https://github.com/simbuerg/etcdump/tree/master/vim
      2. https://github.com/vulder/doto/tree/master/vim
      3. https://github.com/jacoborus/tender.vim, the tender.vim theme.

  # ZshRC:
    The configuration i use in my oh-my-zsh. It is also a mix of:
    1. https://github.com/vulder/doto/tree/master/zsh,
    where the plugins come from and most of the theme originates from.
    2. https://github.com/woefe/git-prompt.zsh, the git prompt i use.
    3. Colour/theme changes I added on my own.
