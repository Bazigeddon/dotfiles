A git back-up of the dotfiles i use personally.

Contains:
  - VimRC:
      My vim config which is a mix of the vimrcs you can find under:
        1.
        2. https://github.com/vulder/doto/tree/master/vim
      and the tender.vim theme added, as some other slight changes.

  - ZshRC:
    The configuration i use in my oh-my-zsh. It is also a mix of this zsh:
    1. https://github.com/vulder/doto/tree/master/zsh,
    the git prompt found under:
    2. https://github.com/woefe/git-prompt.zsh,
    and colour/theme changes I added on my own.
